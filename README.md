Special Thanks to Adrian Daucourt for sharing the code in his blog.  Made some minor modifications   
The modifications have been made to save the files in csv format for use with several different SIEM products such as ArcSight, Qradar, Splunk etc. 
Also trying to implement a Threat Actor Model on the SIEM platforms. 

Please feel free to request changes or additions to threat / CnC sites and I will add it to the code
